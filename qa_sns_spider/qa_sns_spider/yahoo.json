Two 1/4 parts of 1 pill, some vitamins to give her her appetite back, and some antibiotics (nothing for the ear mites. I had been treating it with over the counter stuff). She got on all of that and was eating again within a day. Before she got sick she was eating solid food with no problems, but after she got sick all of a sudden she can't handle it. I took her off of the antibiotic after about 2 weeks because it was making her throw up everything she ate, and now that she's off she can keep down kitten formula, but can no longer take solid food without throwing it right back up. Can anyone think of a reason why? I'm considering taking her back to the vet, but really can't afford it, so if I could get some help here that would be great.

You KNOW UV is bad for your eyes, and you trust that the glasses will do what the label claims. Yet you don't think about or investigate how the UV is blocked by the lenses (or rather the coating) before it hits your eyes. You trust that the Scientists who discovered, patented and perfected this coating knew what they were doing. Likewise when you take an analgesic like Asprin or Tylenol. You trust that the Scientists that discovered these drugs knew what they were doing. You trust that the Science behind these drugs is sound and that it is being perfected and researched on an ongoing basis. Yet you don't look into how these drugs are made or how they work. So why, when it comes to the Science of Evolution, do you balk and deny? The Science is there, it has over 150 years of peer reviewed Science backing it and to this day, not ONE single theory has ever given us a different explanation as to the changes biology undergoes over time.

When he said \"you are a blessing\", that means you are a good thing in his life, someone who inspires and motivates him.  You didn't say which church, so I'll try and give you some straight forward generic info.  Most Christian churches believe in the Bible. The Bible is a combination of 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament. The NT is about Jesus Christ's life here on earth. Jesus had 12 apostles who received the Melchizedek priesthood from him. None of the apostles passed their priesthood on to anyone else and therefore was lost. Almost 200 years ago, it was restored.

The Christian church is based on the following of Christ Jesus and his teachings as written in the Bible.  Basically, the church was established by Jesus' disciples, especially Paul who helped start many of the original Christian churches.  Our Bible was written by various people in history, from Moses and the prophets of the Old Testament to Jesus' disciples in the New Testament.  Our main belief is that we are all sinners and have been disconnected from God due to our own sin.  God chose the Jewish people to be a nation of priests for him and gave them rules to live by.  However, these rules, like the 10 commandments, for example, do not allow us to actually get rid of our sin.  We can't get close to God directly because God is perfect and we, obviously, are not.  However, God loves us so much that he sent his son Jesus into the world as a human to be sacrificed as a sin offering for all of our sins.  To become a Christian you have to recognize the fact that you are a sinner and want be forgiven.  Acknowledge that you believe that Jesus is the Son of God and died for you and ask him to come into your life.  Your name will be written in God's book of life for the end of the world.  The Bible tells us that All have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, and are justified freely by his Grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.  It goes on to teach us that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. We cannot reach God and have eternal life through any works of our own.  In Ephesians, Paul teaches us that is 'by Grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so that no one can boast.  We do good works because we love God, it is the result of our faith, not to try and enter Heaven.  You can't get to Heaven by being 'better' than anyone else.  We are all in the same boat.  Jesus died on a cross to save us from our sins and was buried and rose again as our savior.  We don't worship a crucified lord, but a risen savior.  We have faith that he will return for all who have called upon His name when the time comes and we will go to Heaven.   Do you know what faith is?  Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.  When God returns to Earth and everyone is judged, if your name is not written the Book of Life, you will be judged for all of your sins.  However, the Good News is that if you believe in Jesus and have confessed this and asked Him to come into your life, God will accept you into his Heaven, because he will see Jesus in you instead of you alone.  Jesus covers your sins.  God offers this gift for anyone who believes, no matter what race.  This does not mean that after we are saved that we will not sin.  However, we will be forgiven of our sins when we ask for forgiveness.  We are a part of the family and brothers and sisters in Christ.  Does your father disown you because you do something wrong?  Of course not.  He is disappointed in you and you will feel bad until you tell him about what happened and ask him to forgive you.  Same thing with God, but you must come to him freely of your own choice through Jesus or He can't recognize you as one of his own. As to the Church itself, churches were established in many countries and slowly spread west. The Catholic church had a major impact in spreading the news and many other denominations eventually sprang up with different customs and/or beliefs, but underlying them all is the Good News of Jesus. Like I've said before, we all are sinners and always will be.  Churches have many people in them that are not Christian.  Some will fall away, but hopefully we are all seeking the same thing and they will eventually see the light, but others are still blind and only go for other reasons like just being part of a social group.  We have to reach out to these people and not reject them for we are no better than they are. May God bless you in your journey.  Ask your boyfriend your questions.  Don't be shy. Tell him you don't understand, but want to learn.   He will be more than happy to help!", "answering_date": "2013-09-01 00:13:04 +0000", "question_id": "20130831161433AAk89f5", "answer_id": "OpdqAGHuLEFkhc6CflQx"},

Took Plan B but having weird symptoms. PLEASE HELP.?", "question_content": "Hi. So here is my whole story. On August 4-8th I had my period. Two days after my period finished I was fooling around with my boyfriend and he went in me without a condom for less than 10 seconds and then I stopped him. Even though it was close to my period so I probably wasnt ovulating, I got so worried I took Plan B on Monday August 12th. 5 Days later I started bleeding- even though it was only a little over a week since my period ended. At first it was light pink and light brown but it ended up lasting 4 days (until the 20th) and got as heavy as a normal period. A week later, on August 27th, I went out for pizza and while drinking my coke I fainted. I googled it and freaked out because it is a symptom of pregnancy and I have never fainted before. I am supposed to get my period on September 4th. So yesterday (5 days before my expected period) I took a home pregnancy test in the morning and it came out negative. Also yesterday and today my pee has been completely clear and I have had alot of discharge. I know clear pee means you are hydrated but I haven't drank more water that I usually do. Besides that I havent noticed any unusual symptoms. Also this whole time i have had sex several times but each time we used a condom and pulled out like we usually do. What are the chances that I'm pregnant? What else could explain the fainting and clear pee? Does the bleeding a week after taking plan B mean I'm not pregnant and if so is my cycle all screwed up now? Was the test too early to tell?", "asker": {"user_id": "xWMrVlQLaa", "user_name": "Megan", "user_url": "http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile?show=xWMrVlQLaa"}, "number_of_answers": "1", "import_date": "2013-09-01 Sunday 09:44:07 CST", "asking_date": "2013-08-31 19:55:44 +0000", "number_of_interesting_marks": "0", "question_id": "20130831125544AA1SA8W"},

In the parable of the lost piece of silver, that which is lost, is one piece, of small value compared with the rest. Yet the woman seeks diligently till she finds it.

You can't force yourself to believe in God, it just happens.  But some things that help me with my belief in God: 1.) Look at the world around you!  Beautiful nature, perfect ecosystems, harmony between animals.  Look at yourself!  You have a brain that is constantly sending thousands of chemical messages throughout your body to do even the simplest things.  We have a sense of justice, we could feel love, we could feel sad, we could become jealous, etc.  I really cannot see how emotions are evolutionary. 2.) Does it make sense?  Two tiny particles just floating around in space collided, created the universe, created the Earth, and then life was created in warm water with sun shining it?  Then that tiny organism evolved into us?  I find it awfully difficult to believe. 3.) Have you ever noticed that when you're emotionally hurt, the area of your heart hurts?  An \"inner pain?\"  Amazingly, scientists STILL have no been able to explain why we physical pain when we are emotionally hurt. 4.) Does Hitler and Mother Teresa have the same outcome- death?  With nothing after it?  To me it makes no sense two opposites have the same fate.  I find it hard to believe. 5.) You have all of humanity on your side.  Throughout history, there have seldom been any atheists.  Every civilization on Earth has come up with the notion that God(s) exist, many of them independently!  That definitely says something to me. Your faith will come!  Don't worry about it, keep trying my friend.

But what I do know for certain, is how to cultivate a good relationship with God. I'll share what has helped me. Any relationship must be based on what? Knowledge, would you not agree? A married couple marries after much time spent getting to know the person. It is similar with having a relationship with God, we need accurate knowledge about him. So, really the Bible is the key. Notice what the Bible says at John 17:3 - \"This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ\". The Bible gives us information about God to form a personal relationship with him. I think you may need more assistance than watching Joel Osteen on TV, Why? Well what if you have a question that you need answered? Who would give it? Sometimes we need one-on-one attention. Notice how the Bible makes this point: Acts 8:26-31: However, Jehovah\u2019s angel spoke to Philip, saying: \u201cRise and go to the south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Ga\u2032za.\u201d (This is a desert road.)27With that he rose and went, and, look! an E\u2027thi\u2027o\u2032pi\u2027an eunuch, a man in power under Can\u2027da\u2032ce queen of the E\u2027thi\u2027o\u2032pi\u2027ans, and who was over all her treasure. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,28but he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.29So the spirit said to Philip: \u201cApproach and join yourself to this chariot.\u201d30Philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: \u201cDo you actually know what you are reading?\u201d31He said: \u201cReally, how could I ever do so, unless someone guided me?\u201d And he entreated Philip to get on and sit down with him. Notice much like you the Eunuch needed some help, he got it from Philip. So in your quest to seek out God may I make a suggestion? Have someone come to you and study the Bible with you. If you would welcome that, go www.jw.org click on the \"Request a Bible Study\" tab on bottom of page.

At the highest point along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand; beside the gate leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries aloud: \"To you, O people, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind. You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, set your hearts on it. Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right. My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness. All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse. To the discerning all of them are right; they are upright to those who have found knowledge. Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold, for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her. \"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion. To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behaviour and perverse speech. Counsel and sound judgement are mine; I have insight, I have power. By me kings reign and rulers issue decrees that are just; by me princes govern, and nobles\u2014all who rule on earth. I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me. With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity. My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver. I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice, bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me and making their treasuries full. \"The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old; I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be. When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, when there were no springs overflowing with water; before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth, before he made the world or its fields or any of the dust of the earth. I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep, when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep, when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth. Then I was constantly at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence, rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind. \"Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways. Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it. Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway. For those who find me find life and receive favour from the Lord.

As you will see, there are other ways of getting a UTI. Regardless you really need to see a doctor otherwise it could get worse. Most urinary tract infections are bladder infections. A bladder infection usually is not serious if it is treated right away. If you do not take care of a bladder infection, it can spread to your kidneys. A kidney infection is serious and can cause permanent damage. What causes urinary tract infections? Usually, germs get into your system through your urethra, the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body. The germs that usually cause these infections live in your large intestine and are found in your stool. If these germs get inside your urethra, they can travel up into your bladder and kidneys and cause an infection. Women tend to get more bladder infections than men. This is probably because women have shorter urethras, so it is easier for the germs to move up to their bladders. Having sex can make it easier for germs to get into your urethra. You may be more likely to get an infection if you do not drink enough fluids, you have diabetes, or you are pregnant. The chance that you will get a bladder infection is higher if you have any problem that blocks the flow of urine from your bladder. Examples include having kidney stones or an enlarged prostate gland. For reasons that are not well understood, some women get bladder infections again and again. What are the symptoms? You may have an infection if you have any of these symptoms: You feel pain or burning when you urinate. You feel like you have to urinate often, but not much urine comes out when you do. Your belly feels tender or heavy. Your urine is cloudy or smells bad. You have pain on one side of your back under your ribs. This is where your kidneys are. You have fever and chills. You have nausea and vomiting. Call your doctor right away if you think you have an infection and: You have a fever, nausea and vomiting, or pain in one side of your back under your ribs.

Only what God has chosen to reveal of Himself can be known. One of God's attributes or qualities is \u201clight,\u201d meaning that He is self-revealing in information of Himself (Isaiah 60:19; James 1:17). The fact that God has revealed knowledge of Himself should not be neglected (Hebrews 4:1). Creation, the Bible, and the Word made flesh (Jesus Christ) will help us to know what God is like. Let's start by understanding that God is our Creator and that we are a part of His creation (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1) and are created in His image. Man is above the rest of creation and was given dominion over it (Genesis 1:26-28). Creation is marred by the fall but still offers a glimpse of God\u2019s works (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 1:19-20). By considering creation's vastness, complexity, beauty, and order, we can have a sense of the awesomeness of God. Reading through some of the names of God can be helpful in our search of what God is like. They are as follows: Elohim - strong One, divine (Genesis 1:1) Adonai - Lord, indicating a Master-to-servant relationship (Exodus 4:10, 13) El Elyon - Most High, the strongest One (Genesis 14:20) El Roi - the strong One who sees (Genesis 16:13) El Shaddai - Almighty God (Genesis 17:1) El Olam - Everlasting God (Isaiah 40:28) Yahweh - LORD \u201cI Am,\u201d meaning the eternal self-existent God (Exodus 3:13, 14).

One of them, given a small army ( the other had a larger role in the army of Saddam), used his powers to abuse women, particularly prostitutes.  He would abuse them, and sometimes just have them killed.  Morals?  none. Women are meant to be used and abused, and killed if necessary.  At least, by his morals. Our upbringing places many morals into our way of living, and we carry these through life. This upbringing could include religious teachings, which as I said, are set standards.  This then makes us have pretty much the same standard morals as other religious people, in our denomination. Sure, some will be different, because of how their parents bring them up, they might not see all the religious morals as being what they want, so they teach their children differently, to a point.

We feel for others to whom we feel connected. The only thing that has changed is who we feel connected to (this has grown due to peace, lack of competition for vital resources and TV) and what we feel is an appropriate way to treat those with whom we do not empathise. It used to be that we would feel empathy and group loyalty only to our own pack or tribe - as hunter gatherers this is a group of maybe 12 to 30 people - then we settled and group loyalty became more complex. We still see in some parts of the world, factions capable of great empathy and compassion to their own people but great barbarity to others. We still see this in our cousins the chimpanzees. We do not see this in our other cousins, the Bonobos and the reason for that is that they have not had to fight for resources. There has been plenty for all and so no Bonobo has ever been known to have killed another. They have a concept of morality - they had the concept of rape before we did. They can afford this luxury because where there is plenty, there is no need to see others as 'other' and dehumanise (or debonoboise) them. During the Holocaust, the Nazis dehumanised the Jews but there is one famous account of a guard told to take children and execute them. In leading them away, a little girl took his hand. He was a father and this felt so familiar, he suddenly realised she was human and could not kill her. This is what it all comes down to. Every case of mass aggression and violence is down to dehumanising some group - whether its Shia and Sunni or Israeli and Palestinian or hate crime against homosexuals. We dehumanise people so we can be cruel to them. TV stopped a lot of this - we can see that people of a different race, religion whatever have the same feelings as us. It is not a coincidence that what Pinker calls The Rights Revolution - gender, race, sexuality took a big leap when we had TV.

Would it be OK to use my psychic ability just ONE MORE TIME to find a job?", "question_content": "I got involved with psychic ability, magic, and the occult back in high school. I started \"developing\" that power. After 2 years, I could \"sense\" peoples' thoughts if I concentrated, but, more importantly, subtly influence them \"within the normal range of possibilities\". I could ask someone of a favor, concentrate in a \"special\" way on them, and they would be persuaded (with magic). I could also spontaneously make people trip or twitch. I used that power to get out of trouble so many times. Like that time I got an MIP, focused hard on the cop, and gained enough control over him to get him to destroy the ticket. Or that time I was driving drunk and was followed by a cop, I focused on him one thought \"LEAVE ME ALONE NOTHING TO SEE HERE\" and he did. Or that other time I was high as fock, I got busted, had a four loko in my car, focused the thought \"let the poor kid go\" on the cops and they even LET ME DRIVE AWAY!!!!! I also tested this ability through a controlled experiment with taking 2 decks of cards, taking out 2 reds 2 blacks, and one-at-a-time guessing if they were red or black. I got 68 out of 100. Doesn't sound impressive (unless you know statistics). I crunched the numbers and figured out that the odds of that happening through pure chance was 0.01%. Then, I found out that this power comes from the devil and proceeded to quit and never use it again. Since then I only really used it to get out of a really bad pinch like getting busted or \"predicting\" which way my stock would go (to see if I should sell). Now the big question. Since I have used this demonic power so many times, and all those times for so little gain... would it be morally OK to use it, just ONE MORE TIME, but make this last time count. To use this demonic power to focus on the interviewer when I get a job interview with one sheer suggestion \"hire him he's awesome\". If I could get myself out of impossible situations, like being pulled over when I was blazed and had a bottle in plain sight, then surely I have enough power to convince the HR lady to hire ME and not the 100 other applicants. Plus I need a job after I graduate college. So given how many times I used this evil power, surely it can't hurt to do it just ONCE MORE to avoid long-term unemployment?", "asker": {"user_id": "CC1MOPrqaa", "user_name": "Jghkgjy", "user_url": "http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile?show=CC1MOPrqaa"}, "number_of_answers": "6", "import_date": "2013-09-01 Sunday 09:44:11 CST", "asking_date": "2013-08-31 22:19:41 +0000", "number_of_interesting_marks": "0", "question_id": "20130831151941AALIkF6"},

You don't have to like something to tolerate it.  in fact, the more you like something, the less toleration is needed.  Toleration is putting up with something you don't like. I would take respecting a belief to mean you find value in it.  You can certainly find value in something you don't believe in.  For example, I know many people who have been guided to be good and loving people because of Christianity, but I don't believe in it. Sometimes when people say \"respecting the beliefs of others\" they mean \"respecting people's right to belief in other things,\" which is toleration. Religion as a whole does not tell people to treat other people inhumanely.  On top of which, the ultimate choice of behavior comes from the believer.  Some people cite Christianity as the reason they are treat people badly, but others cite Christianity as the reason they treat people well.  Why define Christianity only by the first group? If someone is preaching sexism or homophobia and you speak up, you are speaking up against sexism and homophobia, not their religion as a whole. \"Respecting someone's right to believe\" means generally not getting in way of their faith, so long as they aren't overly intruding upon others.  I would also include not talking **** about someone just because of their faith, although you can certainly criticize specific aspects.  It's the difference between \"He's just one of those dumbshit Christians\" and \"I'm really offended by his sexist attitudes (which he justifies with his faith), and I won't stand around silently listening as if I find is acceptable.

When you answer this question, please define the word tolerance (not directly from a dictionary, but I suppose rather from this point or something or other). Anyway, I respect people's right to have their beliefs, but I don't like them one bit, which is why I am a pretty hardcore antitheist (and atheist). Basically, I will NEVER respect someone's beliefs if what they believe means that a group of people will be treated less humanely than any other group, which is exactly what religion does, but I respect their right to actually believe in God... I can't really say I respect their right to believe in religious teaching if I am the... opposite of a fan of them (the teachings). I mean, if someone preached openly about God and stuff, I'd probably give him an angry look but walk past, but if he preached about sexism or homophobic stuff, I'd probably tell him to shut the f*ck up. I don't know exactly where I'm going with this, but you'll hopefully understand. I'll add more stuff if I can think of anything. Also, can someone tell me what to say to people when they tell me to respect their right to believe (not what they believe, but right to believe)? To be fair, I never understood what \"respecting someone's right to believe\" really meant.

Because evolution the way its described makes it a faster process than what it probably was. If there was too much of a jump in an evolutionary trait then that animal would be killed or never to mate. So the 8 stages of Darwinism I reject because its probably closer to 1 million stages. But my question is where are those in betweens? We are here and so are monkeys so that leads me to believe that either we came from an ape never recorded by us or the in between stages were not important enough to remain. But just because you believe in adaptation and the Bible doesn't mean you contradict your beliefs because from dust we were formed could of been the bacteria that resides in the dust.

WHEN you hear the terms \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit,\u201d what comes to your mind? Many believe that these words mean something invisible and immortal that exists inside us. They think that at death this invisible part of a human leaves the body and lives on. Since this belief is so widespread, many are surprised to learn that it is not at all what the Bible teaches. What, then, is the soul, and what is the spirit, according to God\u2019s Word? \u201cSOUL\u201d AS USED IN THE BIBLE First, consider the soul. You may remember that the Bible was originally written mainly in Hebrew and Greek. When writing about the soul, the Bible writers used the Hebrew word ne\u2032phesh or the Greek word psy\u00b7khe\u2032. These two words occur well over 800 times in the Scriptures, and the New World Translation consistently renders them \u201csoul.\u201d When you examine the way \u201csoul\u201d or \u201csouls\u201d is used in the Bible, it becomes evident that this word basically refers to (1) people, (2) animals, or (3) the life that a person or an animal enjoys. p. 209Let us consider some scriptures that present these three different senses. People. \u201cIn Noah\u2019s days . . . a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.\u201d (1 Peter 3:20) Here the word \u201csouls\u201d clearly stands for people\u2014Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Exodus 16:16 mentions instructions given to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna. They were told: \u201cPick up some of it . . . according to the number of the souls that each of you has in his tent.\u201d So the amount of manna that was gathered was based upon the number of people in each family. Some other Biblical examples of the application of \u201csoul\u201d or \u201csouls\u201d to a person or to people are found at Genesis 46:18; Joshua 11:11; Acts 27:37; and Romans 13:1.", "answering_date": "2013-08-31 22:45:40 +0000", "question_id": "20130831153221AArZvtn", "answer_id": "JoF5G3TADm3xDwr2i063"},

Dark, light.  White, black.  Positive, negative.  and so on.  Without balance, things cannot exist. Even when we walk, we use muscles to keep our balance, some pulling one way, and then others the other way, to keep us from falling. So, for the possibility of humans to exist ( or any living thing) there has to be balance. If a human's muscles stop working in one direction in the legs, that person would fall down. That is how it works, God did not make the person fall down, the muscles did. But if God was to remove the muscles to keep the person from falling down, then the person would be totally unable to walk at all.  And if God was to make the muscles to never get tired or stop working, the person would live forever, he would never wear out.   And a few thousand years of life, can become rather boring and tiring in itself. The point is, God did not put \" bad \" into the world, it simply exists, because \"good\" exists.  It is the balance.  But it is up to us, to choose if we allow \"good\" to influence us, or \"bad\" to influence us. INFLUENCE.  That is the word.  We are not forced to do anything, we are influenced to do things.  And we choose, the easiest path at times, sometimes thinking it is more FUN, and so we choose the \"bad\" path. Take an example, a person can exercise daily, working an hour or more execising, to keep fit.  Or, the person can simply not do anything, and keep eating junk food, and gain weight.  The second is the easiest path, but not the best.  We choose according to our desires. God could remove all things that cause us pain, but then that would make us unable to do anything, because all things we do, have a possibility of getting hurt.  Try riding a bicycle every day and you have the possibility of falling off of it, or getting knocked off of it.  Try walking and you can trip over something, or kick a stone and hurt your foot.  Try eating and you can choke on a piece of meat, or swallow and have it go down the wrong pipe in your throat. Everything we do, has the possibility of having pain involved.   THAT is LIFE. God does NOT hurt us, we hurt ourselves. Why do we attack others, if we think we are right and they are wrong?  There is no need for that, but we still do it.  And sometimes, it can lead to war. War is pain, suffering, and a bad choice, but it happens. don't blame God for it.", "answering_date": "2013-08-31 22:47:02 +0000", "question_id": "20130831153147AAzYVox", "answer_id": "F5F4CzbuVTbXYXKG9f9bX9q7s8wsPhSffkf84ooLTdHupTZGn.Ft"},
